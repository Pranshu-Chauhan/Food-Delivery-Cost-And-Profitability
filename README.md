# Food Delivery Order Cost and Profitability Analysis

This Jupyter Notebook analyzes food delivery order data to assess profitability and identify areas for improvement. It calculates key metrics, visualizes data distributions, and simulates profitability under recommended commission and discount strategies.

## Key Functionalities

* **Data Preparation:**
    * Converts date/time columns to datetime format.
    * Extracts numerical values from the "Discounts and Offers" column for accurate calculations.
    * Calculates "Discount Percentage" and "Discount Amount" based on extracted values.
* **Cost and Profitability Analysis:**
    * Calculates total costs per order (delivery fee, payment processing fee, discount amount).
    * Estimates revenue based on commission fees.
    * Calculates profit (revenue minus total costs) per order.
    * Aggregates data to understand overall revenue, costs, and profitability.
* **Data Visualization:**
    * Creates histograms, pie charts, and bar charts to visualize profitability distribution, cost breakdown, and overall revenue vs. costs vs. profit.
* **Profitability Simulation:**
    * Identifies characteristics of profitable orders (commission and discount percentages).
    * Suggests a "sweet spot" for commission and discount rates based on profitable orders.
    * Simulates profitability using recommended rates and compares it to actual profitability distribution.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.x
* pandas
* matplotlib
* seaborn

**Assuming you have Python and the required libraries installed, you can proceed directly to running the Jupyter Notebook.**

### Running the Analysis

1. Open a Jupyter Notebook environment (e.g., using `jupyter notebook` in your terminal).
2. Navigate to the directory containing the `Food_Delivery_Cost_Profitability_analysis.ipynb` file.
3. Open the notebook in your Jupyter Notebook interface.
4. Run the code cells (sequentially or by code blocks) to execute the analysis steps.

The notebook provides detailed explanations and visualizations throughout the analysis.

## Further Exploration

* Analyze data from different regions or timeframes within the Jupyter Notebook. Modify the data loading section to specify a different CSV file.
* Explore additional profitability factors beyond commission and discounts. You can add new code cells to investigate these factors.
* Implement machine learning models to predict order profitability. This would require additional libraries and code modifications.

This Jupyter Notebook serves as a foundational tool for analyzing food delivery order data. Feel free to adapt and extend the code for further exploration!
